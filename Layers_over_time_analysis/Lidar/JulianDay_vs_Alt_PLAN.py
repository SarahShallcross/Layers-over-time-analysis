Combine layer analysis to create layer thickness over time.  
Start with top and bottom of layer - i.e. show overall area enhanced by aerosol.
"""

# Needed:
    # Function to find top and bottom of the enhanced area - i.e. find average
    # Find Julian day of each day
    # Test for July
    # Loop this function to work for all days of July
    # Loop this function to work for all days of each month
    # Plot Julian day vs height of points
    
    # At the moment the code just plots the backscatter vs altitude with highlighted regions
    # Need to plot those points - i.e. Julian Day vs bottom section and top section
